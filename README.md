# Module 12: UFO Sightings with Javascript

## Overview of Project

The purpose of the project was to create a website allowing for more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Users are able to filter the website table on multiple criteria.

## Results

The UFO sightings website table now has five criteria on which to filter:

* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

User can filter on one or as many filters as they like. This allows for more a more fine-grained experience. The following is an example of how the site could be used.


![State filter](challenge/static/images/ca_filter.png)
*Filtering UFO sightings in California*


![City filter](challenge/static/images/el_cajon_filter.png)
*Filtering down to a city*


![Shape filter](challenge/static/images/shape_triangle_filter.png)
*Filtering UFO shape*

## Summary

### Drawbacks
This being a website encouraging "citizen science", it unfortunately does not include any way for those who have experienced a UFO sighting to submit that sighting to the website. 

### Recommendations for further development
Including a submission form at the bottom of the page would make it easier for those who believe they have witnessed a UFO to get their sighting recorded on the website.

Secondly, the site could still use some sprucing up in terms of design. There is a fairly large amount of wasted space, especially at the top left of the page. Further CSS styling could help with that.
